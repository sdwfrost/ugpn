## Introduction

- Why does *anyone* need a Chair in One Health, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics?
- Definitions of these disciplines
- Why might they belong together?
  - Examples of problems in global health
  - Present a case study from our own work
- Challenges and opportunities

---

## One Health

<blockquote>
The collaborative effort of multiple disciplines — working locally, nationally, and globally — to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment
</blockquote>

AVMA, 2008

---

## Bioinformatics

<blockquote>
The study of informatic processes in biotic systems
</blockquote>
Ben Hesper and Paulien Hogeweg, 1970

---

## Biostatistics

<blockquote>
The application and development of statistical theory and methods for the study of phenomena arising in the life sciences
</blockquote>
Chin Long Chiang, 1985

---

### When might One Health, Bioinformatics, and Biostatistics all be important?

> - Emerging infectious disease
>    - Animal health has a direct impact on human health
>        - e.g. Antimicrobial resistance
> - Comparative pathology and medicine
>    - Insights may be gained from investigating similar systems in parallel
>        - e.g. Cancer
> - Environment
>    - Changes in the environment may affect both human and animal health
>        - e.g. Climate change and vector borne disease
> - Microbiomes and viromes

## Zoonoses

- Many emerging infections are zoonotic in nature
  - HIV, Ebola, MERS, ...
- The increasing availability of sequence data allows us to ask questions such as:
  - Where did an emerging disease come from?
  - How many times (and when) did it jump host?
  - Has there been adaptation to the new host?

---

## Hepatitis E virus (HEV)

- HEV typically causes acute hepatitis, but is associated with increased morbidity/mortality in immunosuppressed individuals, including pregnant women
- Exists in several distinct genotypes
- Has HEV adapted to being specialised in humans?

<br>

Genotype | Man | Pig |Other
---------|-----|-----|-----
1        | Yes | No  |  
2        | Yes | No  |  
3        | Yes | Yes | deer, mongoose, rabbit, rat
4        | Yes | Yes | cattle, sheep

## Location

```{r,echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
require(ggmap)
mapdata <- get_map(location=c(lon=30.39093,lat=0.504678),source="google",maptype="terrain",zoom=9)
ggmap(mapdata,ylab="",xlab="")
```

## Red colobus

## Phylogenetic analysis of primate viruses

- SIV, simian foamy virus, simian pegivirus, simian haemorrhagic fever virus...

<img src="assets/img/siv_split_tree.svg" width="40%" style="background: white;">

---

## Animal injuries <br> (n=181 from 1240 participants)

<img src="assets/img/paige_fig1a.png" width="60%">

---

## Primate contacts (n=125)

<img src="assets/img/paige_fig1b.png" width="60%">

---

## Who comes into contact with primates?

- Males (vs. females): odds ratio 3.57
- Fragment community (vs. control): OR 6.53
- Mukiga (vs. Mutooro): OR 1.93

---

## Cross-species spillover

- Blood samples from local villagers are being tested for seropositivity to simian viruses (Bill Switzer, CDC)
- In addition, we are using simple mobile phone based methods for collecting syndromic data

---

## Syndromic surveillance using SMS

<img src="assets/img/symptoms.svg" width="50%" style="background: white;">

---

## A rich source of data

<img src="assets/img/symptoms.png" width="50%" style="background: white;">

---

## Challenges

- Implementation
- Traditional delineations between fields
- Funding territories

---

## Challenges in implementation

- Observational studies
  - Utility of 'causal inference' approaches
- Big Data
  - Does *not* refer to data that are simply large
  - Are we in a 'pre-Big Data' stage?

---

## Barriers between disciplines

<blockquote>
[A]ll a biostatistician does is application. He relies on statisticians to develop statistical theory and methods, on probabilists for probabilistic concepts, and on mathematicians for mathematics. A biostatistician only need look up appropriate formulas and ask the computer to do the computation.
</blockquote>
Chin Long Chiang, 1985 (tongue in cheek)

---

## Barriers

- Different disciplines may have common goals, but different language, journals etc.
  - Biostatistics vs. bioinformatics
  - Statistics vs. machine learning
  - Prevents cross-fertilization of ideas
- We encourage our students and postdocs to focus on a very specific field, to lend them an identity

---

## Mathematical modeling

- Twenty years ago, mathematical modeling of infectious disease was almost a 'data free' activity
  - Now, mathematical models are becoming important in lending mechanistic insights from data

<br>

<blockquote>
The study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies
</blockquote>
Volz *et al.* PloS Comp Biol,<br> following Grenfell *et al.* Science 2004

## Species jumps in MERS-CoV

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggtree)
x <- read.beast("MERS_SaudiArabia_aligned_combined.tree.txt")
tr <- x@phylo
host <- tr$tip.label %>% strsplit(.,"_") %>% lapply(.,"[",2) %>% unlist
dd <- data.frame(taxa=tr$tip.label,host=host)
g <- ggtree(x, right=TRUE) %<+% dd
g + theme_tree2() + geom_point(subset=.(isTip),aes(shape=host,color=host),size=4) + scale_x_continuous() + theme(panel.grid.major   = element_line(color="black", size=.2), panel.grid.minor   = element_line(color="grey", size=.2), panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
```

---

## Inferred number and timing of jumps

---

## Data Science

- The field is becoming more liberal and inclusive
- Shift towards the growing discipline of 'Data Science'
  - As data become more complex, data wrangling becomes more important
  - Need approaches for complex data that scale well
- Current examples:
  - Kaggle West Nile Virus Prediction Competition
  - U.S. Government's Dengue Forecasting Project

---

## Distribution of West Nile Virus positive mosquitoes in Chicago

---

## Barriers in funding

- Although lip service is paid to the importance of One Health, austerity has led funding bodies to focus on their core mission
  - MRC: human health
  - BBSRC: livestock
  - NERC: environment
  - ESRC: social and economic issues
- Availability of funding in veterinary fields often much less than medical counterparts
  - Veterinary clinical informatics
- Challenges in piecing together a cohesive programme from separate applications, and harnessing a wider variety of funding sources

---

## Conclusions

> - *Everyone* needs a Chair in One Health, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics
> - My examples come from infectious disease, but there are many settings where the combination of these disciplines may offer more than each alone
> - Only touched on the statistical issues in these data
>   - Frost et al. *Eight challenges in phylodynamic inference*
>   - Eames et al. *Six challenges in measuring contact networks for use in modelling*
> - More generally, we need champions in these areas to foster collaborations and to do good science

## Microbiomes and viromes

- Increasing evidence that microbiome composition plays a central role in health and disease
- Viromes are fundamentally different than microbiomes as viruses need to infect cells to replicate
- Sequencing technology has led to improved quantification of microbiomes and viromes, and to increased capacity to discover novel pathogens
  - Need for bioinformatics to help process high throughput sequencing data
  - Need for biostatistical models to help identify novel pathogens, for which simple pattern matching algorithms may fail to classify

---

## Viral discovery

- We are working on viral discovery in a number of settings:
  - Idiopathic human hepatitis ('hepatitis X')
  - Immunosuppressed individuals
- Pipeline to remove human DNA and RNA, leaving (hopefully) viral material
- In addition to finding known (but undiagnosed) viruses, a large number of contig sequences do not easily classify
